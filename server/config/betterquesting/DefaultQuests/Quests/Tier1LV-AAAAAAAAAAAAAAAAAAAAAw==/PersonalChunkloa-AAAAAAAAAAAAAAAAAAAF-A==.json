They are our main method of chunk loading on the server, and we ask that you only use them when necessary to help reduce lag.\n\nWe suggest using Personal Anchors before Passive Anchors. If you log off, Personal Anchors will shut down, which prevents them from causing lag and other issues. In contrast, Passive Anchors remain online until the server resets.\n\nWe do not allow World Anchors, so please never use or place them. They always start up when the server does, which is very bad for performance.\n\nOne last suggestion: when you get into heavy automation, especially with systems like Applied Energistics 2 (AE2), partially loading the system can cause many problems. For performance reasons, you should either keep the entire system loaded or not load it at all.\n\nPro-tip: You can use levers on your anchors to turn them off and save fuel![/note]\n\n\nLet\u0027s craft a personal chunkloader. It will load a 3x3 chunk area. You need ender fragments, ender pearls, or coins to power the chunkloader. \n\nPersonal anchors can be powered with ender fragments for 1h, ender pearls for 4 hours, and a varying amount depending on the coin used. \n\nPersonal Anchors§r are loaded once the owner visits, and stays loaded while the player is logged in.\n\nPassive Anchors§r are loaded once the owner visits, and stays loaded until the server resets.\n\nWorld Anchors§r are always loaded, even after a server reset."
