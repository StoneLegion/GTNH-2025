It is played in your birthday suit (no armour/other tools/items/etc). No block placement is allowed. If snow is used, then we will need to make the shovels have silk touch (maybe GT amber or Tinkers, but all shovels need to be the same).\n\nMatches between players can happen anytime, but lets set the next one for Saturday 29th and Sunday 30th of March at 2:00PM EST. Future matches will be every 1-4 weeks depending on demand.\n\nIn the meantime, we will need players to build some arenas, so lets get ir done (or something). I\u0027ll update this when we know where the 1st match will take place."
