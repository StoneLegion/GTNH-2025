Well look no further, you have come to the right place!\n\nWe are using the Server Utilities aka FTB Utilities to claim chunks via the map looking icon in your Inventory Screen at the Top Left. \n\nTo Earn Chunk Claims you need to unlock portions of the Quest Book to get your first few claims.\n\nYour first chunk claim is granted when you complete the quest \"Â§SO...TIRED...MUST...SLEEP...\" in the \"And So it Begins\" tier.\n\nAdditional quests can be earned by completing further quests giving you more claims."
