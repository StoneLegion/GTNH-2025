It is adviseable to not leave holes in your base that others can walk/run/jump/fly/teleport into (use solid blocks for walls/floors/ceilings preferably blocks without any special properties like the dissapearing blocks from Twilight Forest or ones that are 1 pixel too small). Also be aware that most if not all pressure plates are useable by ANYONE on claimed land as are elevators, travel anchors, leviators, minecarts, boats, probably \"some\" magic blocks. We also recommend that you do NOT leave entities outside your protected/enclosed area ESPECIALLY any rockets or your favourites horse/chicken/whatever.\n\nExplosions are enabled everyone in the world including on claimed land. Makes things more \"exciting\"."
