## Server Rules:
- Do NOT annoy Players & Admins.
- Do NOT lag the server & disable automation and chunkloading when you go away for extended periods.
- Do NOT cheat, exploit, steal, dupe, etc.
- Do NOT be greedy with looting the World, World Generation, TPS, etc. This is a shared server of many not your private 1 person server.
- Do NOT ask for items, blocks, land, etc. Even from old players.
- Do NOT Build within 400 Blocks of a Player without Detailed Permissions from said player.

## Summery of Changes:
- Overworld Gen Above Changes: Removed Natura Clouds, Natura Redwood Trees and AE2 Meteors (Keeping the Surface Cleaner)
- Overworld Gen Under Changes: Removed Caves, Mineshafts, Underground Lakes (Help reduce useless underground mob lag)
- Removed LootGames & Rogue Dungeons (Pure Spam, Lag, and Beyond Ugly on the World.)
- Angry Mobs: Removed Kamikaze Passive Animals & Angry Pigmen (What a silly mechanic that we never enjoyed)
- No Bloodmoon (Hurts eyes, causes way too much lag, not really a challenge besides server CPU being taxed)
- Nether to Overworld is now a 1:1 Scale (Promotes the usage of Overworld Travel and maybe even Railroad System!
